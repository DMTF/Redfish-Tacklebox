## About

Redfish Tacklebox contains a set of Python utilities to perform common management operations with a Redfish service.
The utilities can be used as part of larger management applications, or be used as standalone command line tools.

## Installation

### Building from Source

```
python setup.py sdist --formats=zip
cd dist
pip install redfish_utilities-x.x.x.zip
```


## Requirements

External modules:
* redfish: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redfish

You may install the external modules by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Utilities


### Sensor List

```
usage: rf_sensor_list [-h] --user USER --password PASSWORD --rhost RHOST

A tool to walk a Redfish service and list sensor info

required arguments:
  --user USER, -u USER  The user name for authentication
  --password PASSWORD, -p PASSWORD
                        The password for authentication
  --rhost RHOST, -r RHOST
                        The address of the Redfish service (with scheme)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

Example: `rf_sensor_list -u root -p root -r https://192.168.1.100`

The tool will log into the service specified by the *rhost* argument using the credentials provided by the *user* and *password* arguments.
It then traverses the Chassis Collection for the Service, and reads their respective Power and Thermal Resources.
Using the information from those resources, it will build a sensor table and print the information collected.


### Power/Reset

```
usage: rf_power_reset [-h] --user USER --password PASSWORD --rhost RHOST
                      [--system SYSTEM] [--type TYPE]

A tool to perform a power/reset operation of a system

required arguments:
  --user USER, -u USER  The user name for authentication
  --password PASSWORD, -p PASSWORD
                        The password for authentication
  --rhost RHOST, -r RHOST
                        The address of the Redfish service (with scheme)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --system SYSTEM, -s SYSTEM
                        The ID of the system perform the operation
  --type TYPE, -t TYPE  The type of power/reset operation to perform
```

Example: `rf_power_reset -u root -p root -r https://192.168.1.100 -t GracefulRestart`

The tool will log into the service specified by the *rhost* argument using the credentials provided by the *user* and *password* arguments.
It then traverses the System Collection for the Service to find the matching system specified by the *system* argument.
It will perform the Reset action with the specified reset type from the *type* argument.
* If *system* is not specified, and if the Service has exactly one system, it will perform the operation on the one system.
* If *type* is not specified, it will attempt a GracefulRestart.


### Boot Override

```
usage: rf_boot_override [-h] --user USER --password PASSWORD --rhost RHOST
                        [--system SYSTEM] [--target TARGET] [--uefi UEFI]
                        [--reset]

A tool to perform a one time boot override of a system

required arguments:
  --user USER, -u USER  The user name for authentication
  --password PASSWORD, -p PASSWORD
                        The password for authentication
  --rhost RHOST, -r RHOST
                        The address of the Redfish service (with scheme)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --system SYSTEM, -s SYSTEM
                        The ID of the system to set
  --target TARGET, -t TARGET
                        The target boot device; if not provided the tool will
                        display the current boot settings
  --uefi UEFI, -uefi UEFI
                        If target is 'UefiTarget', the UEFI Device Path of the
                        device to boot. If target is 'UefiBootNext', the UEFI
                        Boot Option string of the device to boot.
  --reset, -reset       Signifies that the system is reset after the boot
                        override is set
```

Example: `rf_boot_override -u root -p root -r https://192.168.1.100 -t Pxe -reset`

The tool will log into the service specified by the *rhost* argument using the credentials provided by the *user* and *password* arguments.
It then traverses the System Collection for the Service to find the matching system specified by the *system* argument.
* If *system* is not specified, and if the Service has exactly one system, it will perform the operation on the one system.

The tool will then perform an operation on the Boot object within the matching system.
* If *target* is specified, it will update the Boot object to set the boot override to be *target*.
    * If *reset* is provided, it will reset the system after updating the Boot object.
* If *target* is not specified, it will display the current boot override settings for the system.


### Update

```
usage: rf_update [-h] --user USER --password PASSWORD --rhost RHOST --image
                 IMAGE [--target TARGET]

A tool to perform an update with a Redfish service

required arguments:
  --user USER, -u USER  The user name for authentication
  --password PASSWORD, -p PASSWORD
                        The password for authentication
  --rhost RHOST, -r RHOST
                        The address of the Redfish service (with scheme)
  --image IMAGE, -i IMAGE
                        The URI or filepath of the image

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --target TARGET, -t TARGET
                        The target resource to apply the image

```

The tool will log into the service specified by the *rhost* argument using the credentials provided by the *user* and *password* arguments.
It then builds a request payload to perform a Simple Update action against the Update Service using the image specified by the *image* argument.
The optional *target* argument is used in the request if attempting to update a particular system, device, manager, or other resource.
Once the Simple Update is requested, it monitors the progress of the update, and displays response messages reported by the service about the update once complete.
